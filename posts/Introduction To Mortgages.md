Whether you are a first-time homebuyer or just someone who is simply interested in real estate, chances are you have heard the term “mortgage loan” before.  For simplicity’s sake and to save you from reading an hour-long article, we will be focusing on fixed-rate mortgages for now.  

A mortgage is a secured loan which gives you access to funds by putting up an asset as collateral.  The most common example of this is purchasing a home.  The bank/lending company provides you the necessary funds to buy the property but will hold on to the deed as collateral until the loan is fully paid off.  

As the name implies, a fixed-rate mortgage has a fixed interest rate for the life of the loan.  Most mortgages are fully amortized, meaning that just need to make your regularly scheduled payment each month to pay off the entire loan balance by the end of the term of the loan.  You can make additional payments to the principal in order to pay off the loan faster, but just double check with the lender to ensure there is no prepayment penalty.

We will take a closer look at qualifying in future posts, but there are a few main factors that almost every lender will take into consideration before giving you a loan. 

## Common Qualifying Factors:
  - LTV (Loan to Value)
  - DTI (Debt to Income Ratio)
  - Monthly Income 
  - Credit Score

These qualifying factors could change slightly depending on the loan program, or even the lender you choose.  When shopping around, be sure to ask for estimates as they can give you a good idea of what you are paying for.  Do exercise caution though as estimates can sometimes be misleading by not giving you the entire picture.  If it seems to good to be true, there might be a catch.

I hope this gives you a good introduction to mortgages and what they are.  Although there are many great resources on the internet for information on mortgages, it cannot replace the knowledge of a competent loan officer.  So, no matter if you are experienced in buying real estate or looking to purchase your first home, please find a loan officer you trust to assist on your transaction.
