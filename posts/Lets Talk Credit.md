excerpt: 'How is my credit score used?'
---

I received a few questions recently regarding the role credit scores play in terms of mortgage qualifying and thought that it would be a great topic to cover as almost everyone has credit.

Of course, you want to ensure that your credit score is as high as possible, but there may be diminishing returns when applying for a mortgage.  Each lender/bank is unique, but in general if your credit score is 740 or above, you are most likely considered to be in the top pricing bracket.  When I use the term "pricing", I am referring to the interest rate and points of a loan.   The lower your FICO score, usually means that you will incur additional add-ons to the points.  Points are a percentage of your loan amount which is then added to your closing costs.  Closing costs consist of lender fees, escrow fees, and points.  If you are purchasing a property, then closing costs are usually collected when the loan closes.  The same can be said when refinancing, although you do have the additional option of financing the closing costs through the loan itself assuming you qualify.  

So now that we have a general idea of how credit affects pricing, we can take a closer look at how credit is viewed and determined.

There are three Credit Bureaus that determine your credit score.  The three bureaus are Equifax, Transunion, and Experian.  Usually, each bureau will give a slightly different score, and the lender will use the median of the three as your final score.  This is what is referred to as a Hard Inquiry.  Exercise caution when performing multiple Hard Inquiries on your credit in a short amount of time as it may have an adverse effect on your credit score.  Typically, a Hard Inquiry will be done when your loan application is formally submitted.  If you are still shopping around and are being prequalified, lenders may perform a Soft Inquiry to get an idea of what your score might be.  A Soft Inquiry only pulls one score from one bureau compared to a Hard Inquiry which will pull one from all three.  Soft Inquiries do not affect your credit score.  

Having a low credit score doesnâ€™t automatically disqualify you from obtaining a mortgage or loan, but it may affect your interest rate and points that you pay.  On the other hand, you don't need a perfect 850 FICO score to be in the top bracket of pricing.  As always, be sure to consult a loan officer you trust to assist you in your loan process.
