excerpt: 'Feeling lost? Read this'

Small post this week!  We will be back to our regular content next week.  With school starting up again and work piling up, I figured it would be nice to take a break and talk about the importance of positive mental health.  


It is easy to become accustomed to the monotony and mires of everyday life.  The severity of this feeling varies from person to person, but everyone experiences it at one point or another.  Becoming motivated is easy, but the act of keeping that motivation constant is easier said than done.  Wherever you are on your journey, just remember that success is not comprised or defined by one large victory.  Success is the culmination of small accomplishments and learning from your mistakes.  It is okay to make mistakes, feel lost, feel alone, feel unloved, feel stagnant, be afraid, and fall.  Life isn’t a boulevard of green lights.  Sometimes it’s slow and can even come to a standstill.  Relish these moments as you would not be able to enjoy the highs of it all without the lows.  Keep moving forward and be proud of the person staring back at you in the mirror.
