What is DTI Ratio and why does it matter?  DTI stands for Debt to Income and is one of the main ratios that lenders look at when qualifying you for a loan.  Your DTI is represented as a percentage, and is calculated by taking your total monthly debt, and dividing it by your gross income before taxes.  

Your monthly debt is comprised of your housing expense, and revolving payments.  Lenders use your credit report to calculate revolving debt as it lists all credit card balances/payments, loans, installment loans, etc. that you own.  Alimony and Child Support are also categorized as revolving debt.

Housing Expense consists of P & I (Principle & Interest), Property Tax, Insurance, Association Dues, Maintenance Fees, and PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance).  There may be additional factors to add but the items previously listed are the most common.  If there payments that are related to your home, it most likely would be lumped into this category.

DTI limitations may vary depending on the type of loan and the institution which you are obtaining it through.  45% tends to be the maximum allowable DTI for most loan programs, but of course there are always exceptions.  

Having a high DTI doesnâ€™t automatically disqualify you for a loan.  There are ways to lower it by paying off some of your revolving debts, or just simply bringing in more cash if it is within your means.  As always, be sure to consult with a trusted loan officer or financial professional if you are looking to obtain more information.
