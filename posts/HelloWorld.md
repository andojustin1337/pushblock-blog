excerpt: 'What is Pushblock?'
---

So, I know what you are asking.  What does Pushblock mean?  Those of you who play fighting games such as Marvel vs Capcom, may 
know this reference well.  For the uninitiated, a push block is a guarding technique in
fighting games.  The push block enables you to "push" the opponent's character away while you are blocking and allow you to escape danger.  This blog isn't necessarily about video games, but I thought the name was catchy and rolled off the tongue nicely.    

All gaming references aside, Pushblock was created as an outlet to explore my interests in coding and finance.  This way I can document my progress while concomitantly practicing what I learn.  As my coding repertoire expands, I look forward to updating this blog with new features, and creating content based on these discoveries.  

See you around!
