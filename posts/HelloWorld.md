excerpt: 'What is Pushblock?'
---

So I know what you're asking.  What does Pushblock mean?  Those of you who play fighting games such as Marvel vs Capcom, may 
know what it is in reference to.  For the uninitiated, a push block is a guarding technique in
fighting games where you are able to push the opponent's character away when blocking.  This blog isn't necessarily about gaming, but for whatever reason, I 
thought it rolled off the tongue nicely.    

All gaming references aside, I created Pushblock as an outlet to explore my interests in coding and finance.
As my coding repertoire expands, I will be updating and adding new features accordingly.  What better place than a blog to document these findings as well as any
mistakes along the way?  Hopefully you (the reader) can learn from my mistakes and victories to aid your personal journey as well.  

As previously stated, Pushblock will be focused primarily around coding and finance, but I may delve into other topics from time to time.
That is all for now.  Stay tuned for new content coming your way soon.
